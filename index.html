    	Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
    	Structural semantics provide authors and publishers a method of conveying intent and specific meaning to HTML tagging. A digital publishing structural semantics vocabulary defines a set of properties or behaviors relating to specific elements of a publication. This can improve the user experience for sighted and non-sighted readers.</p>
            <p>This document provides use cases for a structural semantics vocabulary for digital publications and recommendations for next steps toward incorporating the vocabulary into the OWP, as envisioned by the W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group and the International Digital Publishing Forum. The use cases are provided as a means to drive forward the conversation about standards in this arena.
            </p>

    <h2 id="criteria">
    	Success Criteria and Options
    </h2>
    <p>There are several options available for inclusion of a rich vocabulary of publishing terms; however there are also several factors that determine the success of a method. The following criteria must be met:</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>Validation on open web platform:</strong> The solution should use a native OWP construct, such that the resulting content remains valid HTML5.</li>
                <li><strong>Serialization agnostic:</strong> The solution must be directly usable in both serializations of HTML5, without any variations in syntax.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized vocabulary support</strong> to allow expression of domain-specific concerns. The solution should allow domain-specific values to be used without an impact on validity, while also conveying information for how User Agents must deal with unrecognized values.</lI>
                <li><strong>Clear AT contract:</strong> The solution must come with a native OWP contract that describes how Assistive Technologies will make use of the provided semantics when rendering the content. The contract must also describe AT behaviors for when the provided semantics are unrecognized, as well as AT behaviors for the case where the inflected semantics conflict with the given host language semantic.</li>
                <li><strong>Static provisioning:</strong> The solution must not require support for script execution within the User Agent, such that that the provided information remains available in circumstances where scripting is disabled, or not supported at all.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity and terseness:</strong> The solution should be easy to learn, and difficult to get wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Appropriatenes:</strong> The solution's specification makes it appropriate for this specific usage and not overly-complex.</li>
            </ol>
</p>
</section>
 <section> 
    <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
            <p>The Digital Publishing Interest Group and Protocols and Formats will work jointly to create a vocabulary of digital publishing terms. The terms will add specificity to HTML elements, allowing for clear interaction with assistive technolgies, easy reusability. and native validation. The joint task force will write use cases and compare existing vocabularies, including IDPF's <a href ="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/">EPUB Structural Semantic Vocabulary</a> and ARIA <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/roles">Roles</a> to create a recommended list of terms. This will require agreement regarding a non-AT-exclusive usage of the role attribute, centralized vs decentralized vocabulary approaches, and clear understanding of the native host language semantics in case of unrecognized values is clarified. To ensure validation and usage within HTML5, this will also require using the "applicable specifications" gloss to enable usage of values beyond those allowed by HTML5.</p>

            <h2>Enabling Assistive Technologies</h2>
            <section> <h3>Improved Navigation</h3>
                <p>Navigation and way-finding are key elements to enabling all readers access to a publication. Sighted and non-sighted readers must be able to move efficiently between major sections of a publication and be able to quickly locate print-equivalent page boundaries, tables, figures, audio and video clips and other features that they might have chosen to skip during the initial read. The inclusion and identification of specialized navigational elements allows a user agent to open custom navigation options for the user when requested.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Contextual Cues</h3>
                <p>Contextual cues offer a screen reader technology information about deeply nested sectioning structures. Just having followed a link to a new position within the content, she has lost her orientation. The student invokes the screen reader function to report the position within the document hierarchy. As the publisher has provided structural semantics for relevant sections within the content, the screen reader is able to report the position as “volume 1, part 2, chapter 3, subsection 4” although the actual current nesting level is ten levels deep. The student then invokes the screen reader function to read current chapter and subchapter title. The screen reader traverses the sectioning structure upwards until it has located the nearest subchapter and chapter, and renders the title of these to the user. Similarly a blind student is exploring the content of an infographic in SVG format. Though the SVG elements can have textual values, titles and descriptions that a screen reader can voice, the students may need additional context to understand what SVG elements are the legend, data elements or labels. More detailed information on use cases can be found on the WAI wiki.</p>

            <h2>Enabling UA Behavior</h2>
            <p>An additional benefit of vocabulary of publishing terms is that the terms can describe specific behaviors to user agents. Implementation of behaviors has been seen using the EPUB vocabulary on some ebook reading systems.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Intrinsic Glossaries</h3>
                <p>A user is reading a publication that includes specialized terminology. The built-in User Agent dictionary does not include many of these terms. The publication includes explicitly marked-up glossary terms and definitions for the specialized terms in the actual content. As a result, the User Agent is able to harvest these specialized terms and definitions, and expose them to the user via the common term lookup UI.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Publications as domain-specific dictionaries</h3>
                <p>A student is writing a dissertation on old french phonetics, and while reading a medieval french novel, she needs access to etymological and phonological data to help interpret a text. The student locates an e-book dictionary about old french phonetics and imports it into the User Agent. Now she is able to click on a verb in the novel, and have the etymological and/or phonological information displayed dynamically in a pop-up window.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Intelligent Indexes</h3>
                <p>A user is reviewing the index of a lengthy book about World War II. She can tap on the entries listed under the term &ldquo;Normandy&rdquo; to preview the content to which the index refers. This enables her to assess whether she wishes to access that link. Likewise, while reading a section about Normandy, the user can access the index by viewing a display of the relevant index entries and sub-entries. The window might display related index terms or a snippet of the index.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Conditional exposure of optional content</h3>
                <p>A user is reading a book with an extensive amount of footnotes on a device with limited screen real-estate. The user accesses the User Agent’s preferences, and activates a mode where footnotes are hidden from view by default, and instead exposed in a pop-up window only when the user activates a footnote reference link.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Domain-specific content fragments</h3>
                <p>A user is reading a STEM textbook. The content is structured into the domain-specific fragments (e.g. physics: experiment, law; mathematics: theorem, proof) which frequently reference other fragments (&ldquo;as Experiment 2 showed, this approximation is not yet accurate&rdquo;, &ldquo;by Theorem 4 the function must be continuous&rdquo;). The user agent can integrate (activated) references into the reading flow, allowing the user to adapt the level of detail of the content.</p>
